If a project is open source and someone want contribute to this project (this person isn't collaborator) in this
case use the function of github Fork.

When a person isn't collaborator then cannot make push, merge, pull request ... then he must clone the repository in his remote 
repository for this give click to the repository open source Watch, Star and Fork.

Give Fork we can clone the repository open source in our repository github
