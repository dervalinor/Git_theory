if I want to make some changes but I want not save this modifications and change to other branch
then use git stash

git stash

after we can change of branch without problem

git stash list -- see changes saved with stash
git stash pop -- show the changes saved with stash

we could save the changes in other new branch

git stash branch <name_branch>
git commit -- now we could save the changes in this branch

If we want delete a git stash:
git stash drop

the command git stash let to have changes in temporal, is very useful

COMMAND VERY USEFUL: git log --oneline 
show more detail the project of git
