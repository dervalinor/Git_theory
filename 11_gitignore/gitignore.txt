.gitignore - do not send certain files to repository of github, this files are ignore
.gitignore is a list of files to ignore of the repository

If we write in the .gitignore *.jpg indicate to ignore all the files .jpg

Is bad practice save files as pictures or videos in a remote repository !!!!. add all the binary files of url
as a link of picture of red social, cloud, imgur.com ...

First a git pull before git push !!!!
