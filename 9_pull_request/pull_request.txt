In a real project the branch master is block so evoid modify this (git merge), and all proof are 
make in other branch (called staging develop) with a proof server.

To server our send all the project in master for our app or website

First we create a branch where we are going to work, after we will send this code to pull request (intermedary
before of staging develop), pull request is use for revise the code and after send to staging develop.

Pull request - other members of the group of developer can watch the code and approve this.

Finally for make a merge to the branch master we use a pull request, this is characterist of github.
