Flow work

When we made git add, we send our changes to staging (site temporal before of send to local repository), 
this is area of preperation, where git make a tracking, after git commit we will save in the local 
repository.

git commit - send staging to local repository

Then flow work in git is:

We made changes in our project --> git add send to staging --> git commit staging to local repository
--> git push send all to the remote repository in Github

Remote repository is a server where save the our project, use for differents programers can work in a
same project.

git clone url - bring a remote repository a our local repository and no alter a staging

git fetch - if other programer made update remote repository then bring this changes
to our local repository (date base of changes)

git merge - after git fetch we must this command for copy the update in our project,
fusion of version actual with the version of my project.

git pull - fusion of git fetch and git merge
