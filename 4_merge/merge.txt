Now we will learn to fusion of branch with the command:

git merge - join branch

Exercise - fusion of branch master and Git_pro for join the index.html and 
Hallo.py and Biografia.txt

git merge happen in the branch where this, example if we made git merge in 
master then we joined the branch Git_pro to master:

git checkout master

git merge Git_pro - give a message when open vim

git status - see the fusion of branch and too all the commit
of other branch

Problem if two programer modify the same line of code of the same file then
happen a conflict, solution of this conflic is:

git branch Git_pro - Git pro exist after of a merge !!!
git marge master - bring all to branch Git_pro

Solution - choose the line for conserve and delete to other line
