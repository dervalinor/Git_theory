Git

instead of a version of each file, we only save the changes to this file,
this system is called git (version control), manage all the changes made 
in the same file, then different people can work in the same project 
without problem, moreover when there are Errors we can know who made those 
change and we can return other old version of the code.

concluion: git only save the changes in the file and indicate where and when
happaned and who made this changes

Github

Is the social red of the code, where we upload our code to this in a remote 
repository

Nota: learn Gitlab

create a file called biografia.txt and write the command:

git init - this command iniciate repository (data base where save
all the changes)

git add biografia.txt - add the new file to the repository

git commit -m "version 1 of biografia.txt" - send changes to the date base

other option for add files is: git add .

git status - see status of the data base

git diff - show all change history made before git add .
git show - show all change history made after of a commit

git log biografia.txt - see all story of a file

git push - send to the remote repository

git pull - bring all the changes of the remote repository

Note: git apt-get upgrade - update all old files of linux

Note:

git add - we make track to the file (this is temporal, previous to git commit)
git commit - send all for save in the local repository
