Github

Is a website where this have a super server of git, we can this site clone or 
create a repository and share with other people, is the social red of code.

Add README.md for we explain to the people
Optional: add the licence this can optional or free (open source)

We can open a file in Github and exist the options of raw (see file in text), 
blame (people creator of file) and history (as git log, show the commitso)

git clone <link_github>- we can put two type of links https and ssh
git remote add origin <link_github> - indicate a our local repository will 
add to remote resository of github

git remote -- see if exist a remote repository 
git remote -v -- see the link of github
git fetch -- bring the last version of remote repository of github
git push origin <name_branch> - send to origin (link of repository of github)
all the files and changes of the this branch 

Solution to the error first git push:

git pull origin <name_branch --allow-unrelated-histories
bring all the changes of repository github when the histories unrelated, the 
local and remote repository are very different

the we can make git push correct:
git push origin <name_branch> 

Note: we can modify, delete and other options in https://github.com/name_user/name_repository/setting

Exercise

make changes to files of github, commit and git pull
