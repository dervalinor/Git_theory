Public and private keys

The public key, we use for encrypt a message and we can see this message with the private key.
We only can share the public key for other person could code a message and see with private key.

When we make a git push we must put the name of user and password (protocol https) and can be hack, then for evoid this
use public key and private key, too we don't login in github git push and other thing.

Send public to github and connect with new protocol ssh, after github will send its own public key
and created a double way of encryted.

Practice

git config -l : see the config of git (user and email)
git config --global user.email "email_git" : if we want change the user email

Creation of private and public key

ssh-keygen -t rsa -b 4096 -C "email_git"
eval $(ssh-agent -S) : verify if server ssh is working

Now we add the key (add the direction of private key)

ssh-add ~/.ssh/id_rsa 

Note: each pc have own private key

Add to github the public key (NO private key)

go github - setting -SSH and GPG key - add new 

change git clone of https to ssh
change address of git remote

git remote set-url origin <address_ssh>
