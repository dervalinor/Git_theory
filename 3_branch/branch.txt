The branch let work in different thing without affect the main branch, default
all our projects in git are save in the branch master and the last commit is
called HEAD.

When we created a new branch generate a copy the HEAD in other side and 
all the changes made in this new branch no affect to the branch master

git merge - use for fusion of branch

git commit -am "comment about code" - combine git add and git commit, this only
apply to file created before and applied git commit -m, NO new files 

git log --stat - indicate the files changes or added (see number line changes)

git status - we can see the branch where we are working and indicate if 
we must make or no commits, see the HEAD

git branch <name_new_branch> - create a branch 

git checkout <name_branch> - move between branch, let change the HEAD to 
other branch
